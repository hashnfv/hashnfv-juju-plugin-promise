summary: YangForge provides runtime JavaScript execution

  Basically, the framework enables YANG schema language to become a programming language.
  It also utilizes YAML with custom tags to construct a portable module with embedded code.
  It is written primarily using CoffeeScript and runs on Node.js and the web browser (yes, it's isomorphic).
  This software is sponsored by ClearPath Networks on behalf of the OPNFV (Open Platform for Network Functions Virtualization) community. For a reference implementation created entirely utilizing YangForge, please take a look at OPNFV Promise which provides future resource/capacity management (reservations/allocations) for virtualized infrastructure.
  Please note that this project is under active development. Be sure to check back often as new updates are being pushed regularly.
